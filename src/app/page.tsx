            I am a fresh graduate with a degree in Informatics Engineering, who
            has just finished my study journey. My passion and focus lies in
            Software Engineering especially in Frontend. Its not just an option,
            but a calling that drives me to explore and create amazing user
            experiences. I believe that a good user interface is not just about
            a beautiful design, but also about an engaging experience.
